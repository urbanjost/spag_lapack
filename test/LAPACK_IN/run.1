# [-e |--error] [-p p |--prec p]  [-n | --number]
# LEVEL OF OUTPUT
#     - e is to print only the error summary
#     - s is to print a short summary
#     - n is to print the numbers of failing tests (turn on summary mode)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#     ./lapack_testing.py -n
#            Will return the numbers of failed tests by analyzing the LAPACK output
#     ./lapack_testing.py -n -r -p s
#            Will return the numbers of failed tests in REAL precision by running the LAPACK Tests then analyzing the output
#     ./lapack_testing.py -n -p s -t eig 
#            Will return the numbers of failed tests in REAL precision by analyzing only the LAPACK output of EIGEN testings
